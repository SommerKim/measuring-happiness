# The Happiness Project

Our team wanted to create a data table that would provide for easy visualization of three different datasets found on Kaggle: 

### Kaggle Datasets
<ol>
  <li>Suicide Rates Overview 1985 - 2016</li>
  <li>World Happiness Report to 2020</li>
  <li>Human Development DB (GNI by country)</li>
</ol>

The goal was to clean the data with Pandas and then combine the information using SQL queries and joins to create a single dataset that would provide a high view of the data from the three datasets for the year 2015.
