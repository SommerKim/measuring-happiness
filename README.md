# The Happiness Project

Our team wanted to create a data table that would provide for easy visualization of three different datasets found on Kaggle: 

### Kaggle Datasets
Suicide Rates Overview 1985 - 2016
World Happiness Report to 2020
Human Development DB (GNI by country)

The goal was to clean the data with Pandas and then combine the information using SQL queries and joins to create a single dataset that would provide a high view of the data from the three datasets for the year 2015.
