# The Happiness Project

Our team wanted to create a data table that would provide for easy visualization of three different datasets found on Kaggle: 

### Kaggle Datasets
<ol>
  <li>Suicide Rates Overview 1985 - 2016: https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016</li>
  <li>World Happiness Report to 2020: https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report</li>
  <li>Human Development DB (GNI by country): https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/world-bank-gni-ranking,-atlas-method-and-ppp-based</li>
</ol>

The goal was to clean the data with Pandas and then combine the information using SQL queries and joins to create a single dataset that would provide a high view of the data from the three datasets for the year 2015. We would then present the data on an easy-to-navigate website for user exploration.
